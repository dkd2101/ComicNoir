# ComicNoir
A detetive game inspired by old noir films with UI inspired by american comic books and comic book panelling published on itch.io [here](https://dylan-dino.itch.io/comic-chevalier)

## Why'd we make this?
This was a project made as a part of our Game Interface Design class. Make connections between pieces od evidence you find in the crime and talk to suspects and witnesses to determine who murdered the victim. Find evidence at the crime scene to use to make conclusions. Enjoy dialogue and art inspired by american commic books with dialogue on screen that uses classic comic book style and art.

## What'd we learn?
We learned a lot about making decisions on what systems and functionality were necessarry to make an MVP. We aimed to develop systems in Unity that allowed for flexibility for designers to easily create new pieces of evidence, new strings of dialogue, and new evidence concusions using Unity Scriptable Objects and scripts made using C#. This meant that we could focus our users to designers and allowed us to focus on making tools to help development and flexible to change. We also learned a lot about interaction design and making sure the player was never lost or stuck when solving our mystery by running multiple playtests when our game had new systems or had certain sytems removed, such as the addition of our "Hot and Cold" sytem when searching for evidence. Timelining, discussion, and cuts were all a necessarry part of this process when working on a time constraint and having our core theme of "mystery and intrigue" guided us along all the decisions we made as a team each week leading up to the deadline.

## Features
- An open dialogue making system that allows designers to insert images and decide how to layout the images alongside the textboxes in the Unity editor.

- A evidence system which allows designers to create new evidence and easily create triggers that will queue a piece of dialogue to be played when making correct connections between evidence. 

- A 2D movement system with sprite depth perception along the z-axis.
